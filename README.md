This is a sample project that uses a REST API with JSON

The API used is themoviedb.org

I am against requiring this type of assignments for job interviews.

* They are bootstrapping a project, that is the smallest part of a real project.
* Anyone can do it by just following a simple set of steps.
* They take quite some time, which I find unfair for an assignment.
 
I think checking the open source projects of a candidate is a much better way of seeing how the candidate codes. In my case I suggest you check Leonids library.

This project is realeased under Apache license, so you can do whatever you want with the code.
